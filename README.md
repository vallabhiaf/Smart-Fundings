## Smart funding
 Smartfunding dApp built on the ethereum blockchain that allows individuals (idea persons from hereon), who do not have sufficient '$$', to bring their ideas to life. And this '$$' is collected from the general public (contributors) who feel that the idea is valuable enough to spend some money on.

#### Key features include:
1. Collected crowdfund in the hands of none, but a smart contract.
2. Spending request to be sent by the idea person to the contract, for requesting usage of fund from the crowdfund.
3. Voting by the contributors on each spending request. Only the majority allows the requested funds to be released.
